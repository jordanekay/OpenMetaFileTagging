## Before You Try It Out ##

Before trying out any of these plugins, it's always a good idea to **BACKUP** all of your Quicksilver data.

This is easily done by backing up the following locations (`~` stands for your home directory, a.k.a. `/Users/you`):

    ~/Library/Preferences/com.blacktree.Quicksilver.plist
    ~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver
    ~/Library/Caches/Quicksilver

## Before Building ##

Before being able to build any of these plugins, you **MUST** download and build the [Quicksilver source code](https://github.com/quicksilver/Quicksilver). This will create some files you need in `/tmp/QS`. Note that to build a plug-in using its Debug configuration, you must first build Quicksilver using the Debug configuration.

See the QSApp.com wiki for more information on [Building Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/wiki/Building_Quicksilver).

Also check out the [Quicksilver Plugins Development Reference](http://projects.skurfer.com/QuicksilverPlug-inReference.mdown), especially the [Building and Testing section](http://projects.skurfer.com/QuicksilverPlug-inReference.mdown#building_and_testing).
